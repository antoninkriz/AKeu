The algorithm is the same, except for minor changes. What changes the most is UX/UI. This time there's no need for any manual setup, manual extracting data from the [Sirius API](https://github.com/cvut/sirius/wiki) and so on.\n\n# Technologies\n\nThe BackEnd part stays the same as in the [older version](/post/ctu-timetable-generator), but instead of outputting all data to the terminal everything is nicely displayed in a browser and rendered using React. \n\n# Screenshots\n\n![](/images/posts/ctu-timetable-generator-new/1.png)\n\n# Installation and usage\n\n**1)**\nGenerate [Sirius API](https://github.com/cvut/sirius/wiki) credentials [here](https://auth.fit.cvut.cz/manager/).\n\n**2)**\nEdit `config.txt`\n\nExample configuration\n```\nCLIENT_ID=Your client id\nCLIENT_SECRET=Your client secret\n\nFACULTY=ID of a faculty (18000 for FIT)\nSEMESTER=ID of a semester (B201 for 2020/21)\n\nCOURSES=Space separated list of courses (e.g. BI-AAG A0B04N3 BI-AG1 BI-ZDM A0B04GA)\nIGNORE_LECT=Space separated list of courses with ignored lectures (e.g. BI-AAG BI-AG1)\nIGNORE_TUTS=Space separated list of courses with ignored tutorials\nIGNORE_LABS=Space separated list of courses with ignored laboratories\n\nNE_730=Should time tables with classes before or at 7:30 AM  be punished? (e.g. true)\nNE_915=Should time tables with classes before or at 9:15 AM  be punished? (e.g. false)\n\nBUILD=Build folder location (e.g. _build)\nPORT=Port which will be used for the HTTP server to serve the generated content\n```\n\n**3)**\nBuild and run the app.\n\n```bash\n./run.sh    # This should be your first step\n\n./_start.sh # Start again when only config.txt changed without rebuild\n\n./_build.sh # Build or rebuild only - useful for development\n```\n"
